title: Record
---

Records are like JavaScript objects but are

- lighter
- immutable by default
- fixed in field names and types
- very fast
- a bit more rigidly typed
- compiles to a JavaScript object still

Because record compiles to a straightforward JS object, you can directly model incoming JS objects as Reason records, **no conversion functions needed**. This is extremely convenient when interoperating with existing JS libraries, since most of them use objects in their APIs and you wouldn't need to wrap those with a layer of Reason APIs.

## Usage

To make a record value, you have to first declare its type:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Reason-->
```reason
type person = {
  age: int,
  name: string
};
```
<!--Output-->
```js
/* Nothing. Types disappear in the output */
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

To use it (this will be inferred to be of type `person`):

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Reason-->
```reason
let me = {
  age: 5,
  name: "Big Reason"
};
```
<!--Output-->
```js
var me = {
  age: 5,
  name: "Big Reason"
};
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

Access a field:

```reason
let name = me.name;
```

### Record Needs an Explicit Definition

Record is one of the very few features in Reason where we mandate you to pre-declare its type before using it. For various performance and type checking reasons. In the above example, if you only write `let me = {age: 5, name: "Baby Reason"}` without an explicit type declaration somewhere above, the type system will give you an error. If the type definition resides in another file or module, you need to indicate it:

```reason
/* file School.re */

type person = {age: int, name: string};
```

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Reason-->
```reason
/* file Example.re */

let me: School.person = {age: 5, name: "Big Reason"};
/* or */
let me = School.{age: 5, name: "Big Reason"};
/* or */
let me = {School.age: 5, name: "Big Reason"};
```
<!--Output-->
```js
var me = {
  age: 5,
  name: "Big Reason"
};
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

Either of the above 3 says "this record's definition is found in the School file/module". The first one, the regular type annotation, is preferred.

### Immutable Update

New records can be created from old records with the `...` spread operator. The original record isn't mutated.

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Reason-->
```reason
let meNextYear = {
  ...me,
  age: me.age + 1
};
```
<!--Output-->
```js
var meNextYear = {
  age: me.age + 1 | 0,
  name: "Big Reason"
};
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

This update is very efficient! **Check the output tab**. Because we know the whole type shape of the record you're updating, we can avoid the JavaScript way of iterating over all the object fields and stuffing them into a new one. Instead, a new record is directly created.

**Note**: spread cannot add new fields, as a record's shape is fixed by its type.

### Mutable Update

Record fields can optionally be mutable. This allows you to update those fields in-place with the `=` operator.

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Reason-->
```reason
type person = {
  name: string,
  mutable age: int
};
let baby = {name: "Baby Reason", age: 5};
baby.age = baby.age + 1; /* alter `baby`. Happy birthday! */
```
<!--Output-->
```js
var baby = {name: "Baby Reason", age: 5};

baby.age = baby.age + 1 | 0;
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

## Syntax shorthand

To reduce redundancy, we provide **punning** for a record's types and values. Punning refers to the syntax shorthand you can use when the name of a field matches the name of its value/type:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Reason-->
```reason
type horsePower = {power: int, metric: bool};

let metric = true;
let someHorsePower = {power: 10, metric};
/* same as the value {power: 10, metric: metric}; */

type car = {name: string, horsePower};
/* same as the type {name: string, horsePower: horsePower}; */
```
<!--Output-->
```js
var metric = true;
var someHorsePower = {
  power: 10,
  metric: true
};
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

**Note that there's no punning for a single record field**! `{foo}` doesn't do what you expect (it's a block that returns the value `foo`).

## Tips & Tricks

### Record Types Are Found By Field Name

With records, you **cannot** say "I'd like this function to take any record type, as long as they have the field `age`". The following does **not** work as expected:

```reason
type person = {age: int, name: string};
type monster = {age: int, hasTentacles: bool};

let getAge = (entity) => entity.age;
```

The last line's function will infer that the parameter `entity` must be of type `monster`. The following code's last line fails:

```reason
let kraken = {age: 9999, hasTentacles: true};
let me = {age: 5, name: "Baby Reason"};

getAge(kraken);
getAge(me);
```

The type system will complain that `me` is a `person`, and that `getAge` only works on `monster`. If you need such capability, use Reason objects, described [here](object.md).

## Design Decisions

After reading the constraints in the previous sections, and if you're coming from a dynamic language background, you might be wondering why one would bother with record in the first place instead of imitating JS and use a catch-all object concept for everything.

The reason is that JavaScript objects can be _really_ slow. Some code might add fieds, remove fields, iterate over them, pass the keys themselves somewhere else, etc. The JS engines nowadays try to "guess" your object's usage patterns and sometime optimize that into a solid C++ struct, but some other time fail to do so and convert your overly dynamic object into a hash map, with a sudden >100x performance degradation (imagine an object field access needing to hash the key and traverse the hashmap to find it).

We love simplicity, but a single all-powerful data structure that is the JS object is a bit too naive. This is why Reason separates the above use-cases into record, and proper hashmap (documented later). This way, you get to leverage the consistently fast record experience, like in the above immutable update section. Field access is also guaranteed to be super fast.

"But doesn't a Reason record compile to a JS object anyway"? Yes, but those records will trigger the JS engines' optimistic object optimizations, since they see that you never tried to e.g. add or remove record fields, iterate through the keys, etc., and therefore they'll never transform your those compiled JS objects into C++ hash maps or other slow data structures. Basically, Reason's type system enforced the disciplined usage of this data structure so that you can guarantee that it will never be accidentally slow.

(And yes, we're aware that it's comical for a language feature to transform into a dynamic-looking JS object, then transformed again by the JS engines into a C++ struct, then end up where we started in the first place. Such is modern engineering.)
