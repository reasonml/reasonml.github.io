title: Native
---

[Bsb-native](https://github.com/bsansouci/bucklescript) is like our JS-side build tool, but that compiles to native code instead.

[Esy](https://esy.sh) is a new package manager that can install native packages from [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/) and native packages hosted on npm. It is a "native-first" workflow with very minimal support for JavaScript/web workflows. 

> **Note**: Esy works on MacOS and Linux. Windows support is considered "alpha".
