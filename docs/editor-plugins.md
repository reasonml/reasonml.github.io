title: Editor Plugins
---

Reason's nature lends itself to great editor support. Most of our editor plugins provides at minimum:

- Types display.
- Programmatic code formatting through `refmt`.
- Errors & warnings display.
- Syntax highlighting.
- Type-driven autocomplete.
- Jump to definition.

And other features.
