title: ReasonConf Videos & Reason 3.3.2!
---

_This release should be used in conjunction with `bs-platform 4.0.3`_.

We recently had our very first [Reason Conf](https://www.reason-conf.com) last May! Videos are available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtFP_Hn5nIbZY4Xi47qfHhw/playlists), if you haven't seen them yet. In short, it was a massive success; big, belated thanks to [@ryyppy](https://twitter.com/ryyppy), [@nikgraf](https://twitter.com/nikgraf) and [@okonetchnikov](https://twitter.com/okonetchnikov). This is truly a conference by the community, for the community.

That being said, we've heard your feedback during the conference loudly and clearly. This Reason release addresses _most_ of those feedback! Special thanks to [@anmonteiro](https://twitter.com/anmonteiro90) and [@iwanKaramazow](https://twitter.com/_iwan_refmt) for many of these fixes.

See the changes [here](https://github.com/facebook/reason/blob/master/HISTORY.md#332). No breaking changes; nothing but an avalanche of quality-of-life improvements. Hopefully you'd notice many subtle tweaks in your day-to-day development.

We've made a new, corresponding [ReasonReact release](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/blog/2018/08/06/050) too. Get it while it's hot!

Thank you for your continued support =).
