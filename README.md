# [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason) Website & Documentation

## Contribute

All pages are in [src/pages/](src/pages/). The markdown files under [src/pages/guide](src/pages/guide/) and [src/pages/community](src/pages/community/) are probably of most interest.

## Building

```
npm install -g bs-platform
yarn install
npm run develop
```

That'll start a hot-loading server & you can make changes & see the results.

If you have push access, to deploy a new version of the site, go to the source branch and do:

```
npm run deploy
```

**Note**: the deployment is currently broken because of gatsby because of webpack because of chunking plugin, because that's life. We've currently cherry-picked the relevant changes into a stable branch called `new-deploy`. Deploy through that one.

The site uses GatsbyJS. For info on how it works, take a look at [their docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

## Building the Playground

The playground uses a bundled JS version of Reason's refmt, [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io) compiler, its standard library, etc.

To build the bundled standard library & refmt: Please read the documentation in `setupSomeArtifacts.js`.

bs: make sure you've got closure compiler, OPAM, js_of_ocaml, reason and menhirLib installed, then invoke black magic at https://github.com/jaredly/bs-refmt-jsoo. Then cry a little and submit a PR to make the process better.
