title: Functions
order: 3
---

Functions are declared with `fun` and return the expression.

```reason
let greet = fun name => "Hello " ^ name;
```

This declares a function and assigns to it the name `greet`, which you can call like so:

```reason
greet "world!"; /* "Hello world!" */
```

Multi-arguments functions have arguments separated by space:

```reason
let add = fun x y z => x + y + z;
add 1 2 3; /* 6 */
```

For longer functions, you'd surround the body with a block:

```reason
let greetMore = fun name => {
  let part1 = "Hello";
  part1 ^ " " ^ name
};
```

**Since function definitions occur often**, we gave `let + fun` a shorthand:

```reason
let add x y z => x + y + z;
/* same as: let add = fun x y z => x + y + z; */
```

**Be mindful of function's precedence**! You need to wrap the call with parentheses in some situations:

```reason
let increment x => x + 1;
let double x => x + x;

let eleven = increment (double 5);
```

If you forget to wrap `double 5` in parentheses, you'd get `increment double 5`, as if the `increment` function wrongly takes two arguments.

#### No Argument

A function always takes an argument; but sometimes, we'd use it for e.g. side-effects, and don't have anything to pass to it. In other languages, we'd conceptually pass "no argument". In Reason, every function takes an argument; here we'd conventionally pass it the value `()`, called "unit".

```reason
/* receive & destructure the unit argument */
let logSomething () => {
  print_endline "hello";
  print_endline "world";
};

/* call the function with the value of type unit */
logSomething ();
```

`()` is a totally normal value, the single possible value in `unit`. Reason/OCaml gave it a special syntax out of convenience.

#### Labeled Arguments
Multi-arguments functions, especially those whose arguments are of the same type, can be confusing to call.

```reason
let addCoordinates x y => {
  /* use x and y here */
};
...
addCoordinates 5 6; /* which is x, which is y? */
```

In OCaml/Reason, you can attach labels to an argument:

```reason
let addCoordinates x::x y::y => {
  /* use x and y here */
};
...
addCoordinates x::5 y::6;
```

Since we have currying (more on that [here](#diving-deeper-more-on-function)), we can provide the arguments in any order:

```reason
addCoordinates y::6 x::5;
```

The `x::x` part during declaration means the function accepts an argument labeled `x` and can refer to it in the function body as the variable `x`. This is so that we can have the following pattern, where labeled arguments are renamed inside the function for conciseness:

```reason
let drawCircle radius::r color::c => {
  setColor c;
  startAt r r;
  ...
};

drawCircle radius::10 color::"red";
```

For the common case of `radius::radius` (where the label is the same as the local variable name), we have the syntax shorthand `::x`:

```reason
let drawCircle ::radius ::color => {
  setColor color;
  startAt radius radius;
  ...
}
```

Here's the syntax for typing the arguments:

```reason
let drawCircle radius::(r: int) color::(c: string) => ...;
```

#### Optional Labeled Arguments

Labeled function arguments can be made optional during declaration. You can then omit them when calling the function.

```reason
/* radius can be omitted */
let drawCircle ::color ::radius=? () => {
  setColor color;
  switch radius {
  | None => startAt 1 1;
  | Some r_ => startAt r_ r_;
  }
};
```

If omitted, `radius` is **wrapped** in the standard library's `option` type, defaulting to `None`. If provided, it'll be wrapped with a `Some`. So `radius`'s type value is either `None` or `Some int` here.

**Note**: `None | Some foo` is a data structure type called variant, described [below](./#built-in-data-types-variant). This particular variant type is provided by the standard library. It's called `option`. Its definition: `type option 'a = None | Some 'a`.

**Note** the unit `()` at the end of `drawCircle`. Without it, since `radius` and `color` are both labeled, can be curried, and can be applied out-of-order, it's unclear what the following mean:

```reason
let whatIsThis = drawCircle ::color;
```

Is `whatIsThis` a curried `drawCircle` function, waiting for the optional `radius` to be applied? Or did it finish applying? To address this confusion, append a positional (aka non-labeled) argument to `drawCircle` (conventionally `()`), and OCaml will, as a rule of thumb, presume the optional labeled argument is omitted when the positional argument is provided.

```reason
let curriedFunction = drawCircle ::color;
let actualResultWithoutProvidingRadius = drawCircle ::color ();
```

##### Explicitly Passed Optional

Sometimes, you might want to forward a value to a function without knowing whether the value is `None` or `Some a`. Naively, you'd do:

```reason
let result = switch payloadRadius {
| None => drawCircle ::color ()
| Some r => drawCircle ::color radius::r ()
};
```

This quickly gets tedious. We provide a shortcut:

```reason
let result = drawCircle ::color radius::?payloadRadius ();
```

This means "I understand `radius` is optional, and that when I pass it a value it needs to be an `int`, but I don't know whether the value I'm passing is `None` or `Some val`, so I'll pass you the whole `option` wrapper".

##### Optional with Default Value

Optional labeled arguments can also be provided a default value. They aren't wrapped in an `option` type.

```reason
let drawCircle ::radius=1 ::color () => {
  setColor color;
  startAt r r;
};
```
