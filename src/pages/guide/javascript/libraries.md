Libraries that have already been wrapped with bucklescript bindings are customarily prefixed with `bs-`, e.g. `bs-director`. [Here's a search](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:bucklescript) for all of the bucklescript related libraries on npm.

TODO give an example of working with e.g. momentjs.
