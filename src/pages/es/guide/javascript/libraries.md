Libraries that have already been wrapped with BuckleScript bindings are customarily prefixed with `bs-`, e.g. `bs-director`. [Here's a search](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:bucklescript) for all of the BS related libraries on NPM.

Take a look at [reasonml-community](https://github.com/reasonml-community) to see a list of curated bindings to JS libraries.

If you can't find what you're looking for: sometimes you don't need a binding to use a JS library. Most JS data types, such as array and objects, [map over cleanly to Reason and vice-versa](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_runtime_representation). You also have access to the familiar [JS API](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js.html). Be sure to also check the "Interop" and "Converting from JS" sections here!
