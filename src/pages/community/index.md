title: Where to get help (and affection!)

Reason is being actively worked on by Facebook engineers that are often around eager to help. But there's also a lively community of engineers from smaller companies and other oddballs that are both knowedgable and available at all hours of the day. Challenge us to a duel at one of the following places:

### ReasonML Discord

Our primary ~~hunting ground~~ meeting place is the [ReasonML Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml). This is the hub of our community, and the place to go when you want immediate help, a bit of back-and-forth or a nudge in the right direction, or just a hand to hold on to for a bit. We also offer experts on both BuckleScript and OCaml and a virtual hot chocolate as a welcoming gift to everyone that stops by!

### Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a great place to ask well-formed questions, getting superb help while simultaneously adding to the collective knowledge base that will help out the guys that come next. Help us trample up the trail (this is a great Norwegian saying that I'm sure translates terribly) by [asking questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=reason) or just look through the [existing questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reason) (and answers, hopefully).

### Twitter

Cheng Lou rides [the ReasonML Twitter account](https://twitter.com/reasonml) hard! Make sure to check out his SoMe swagger!

### Reddit

We also have [a subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reasonml) that isn't entirely abandoned. You could be our n + 1!

### IRC (freenode #reasonml)

There's people on [#reasonml on Freenode](http://irc.lc/freenode/reasonml) too. I think.

### Discussion Forum

There isn't a dedicated discussion forum for Reason, but many Reaon enthusiasts hang around https://discuss.ocaml.org/ and will be happy discuss any Reason-related topic you'd like (possibly even including @chenglou's sleep schedule). Here you'll also be able to get input from the wizards of OCaml about the deepest, darkest secrets of the OCaml type system and other compiler internals. 

If you have a concrete answerable question it might be better to post it on Stack Overflow, however.
