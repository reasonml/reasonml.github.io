- data structures [immutable.re]()
- native compilation in bucklescript's `bsb` (see [this fork](https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native))

Future

- bucklescript gets package-based namespacing (no more conflicts with other packages' file names)

- ...

Far future
- get cross-compilation to android, ios working well
