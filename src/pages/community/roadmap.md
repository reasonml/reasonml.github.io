### Reason Team TODOs

Here's the place to keep up with what's happening for the Reason team! This list isn't exhaustive and might change.

#### Near future

- Validating secret ReasonReact feature, then release it
- Another secret feature
- Syntax change: JavaScript-style function calls [pull request](https://github.com/facebook/reason/pull/1299)
- Testing data structures [immutable.re](https://github.com/facebookincubator/immutable-re)
- Native compilation in bucklescript's `bsb` (see [this fork](https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native))
- BuckleScript gets package-based namespacing (no more conflicts with other packages' file names)

#### Future

- Better async story
- Better dev-time printing facility
- Better JSON facilities
- Sleep more

### Your Contribution Opportunities

Wanna help?

- [Improve the documentation and website](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/issues). There's also the [BuckleScript manual and API reference](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_contributing_to_the_documentation)
- [Help us translate the docs!](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/issues/3)
- [Suggest better error messages](https://github.com/reasonml-community/error-message-improvement/issues)
- Contribute to [your favorite editor plugin for Reason](/guide/editor-tools/editors-plugins#officially-supported-editors)
- On that note: better [ocaml-language-server](https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-language-server). This will potentially power all our editor integration in the future.
- Come up with more [project names starting with "re"](https://github.com/reasonml/ideas-for-project-names-starting-with-re)
- Make bindings! Lots and lots of bindings! Have a look at the [reasonml-community index](https://github.com/reasonml-community/index), see if there's something missing or unfinished, then just get your hands dirty! Most of them could also use better documentation, not just more code.
- Whatever project you'd normally do in JavaScript, try it in Reason + BuckleScript!
- Talk about Reason and BuckleScript!
- Ping @chenglou in [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) for more tasks.
